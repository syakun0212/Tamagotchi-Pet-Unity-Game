# Tamagotchi Pet Quiz Game

Tamagotchi Pet is a quiz-based game, with servers hosted either publicly or
in a schoolâ€™s server system. Tamagotchi Pet aims to facilitate the teaching and learning of
software engineering courses via gamification and socialization.

Students can login to the game in either single-player or multiplayer mode. In single-player
mode, players are able to earn rewards for their pets by answering questions of varying
difficulty. The rewards are given based on the difficulty level of the question. In multiplayer mode, players can challenge their peers and win rewards while doing so. Higher points will allow players to increase their ranking as they climb the leaderboard. This motivates the players to keep improving themselves and solve the questions faster.

Teachers can login to the game to view the summary report of the students and based on this
report, teachers can reasonably adjust the teaching contents and key points during the
classroom teaching. Teachers can also login to add/remove/edit the quizzes in the database.
